## Features:

1.Homepage (index.html): A landing page that greets visitors with an overview, along with call-to-action buttons like downloading the CV or making contact.

2.About Me (intro.html): Delve into Josh's personal and professional journey. Explore his skills and take a closer look at projects that spotlight his expertise.

6.Hamburger Navigation: An intuitive sidebar navigation menu, ensuring seamless movement across the website regardless of the device or screen size.

7.Footer: Every page concludes with a structured footer offering quick links, contact information, and copyright acknowledgments.

## Responsiveness
Built with a mobile-first approach, the website delivers a consistent and engaging user experience across devices â€“ be it mobile, tablet, or desktop.

## Styling and Interactivity
All visual designs and interactivity have been achieved using styles.css for styling and script.js for JavaScript-based functionalities.

## The website's JavaScript accomplishes the following:

1. Navigation Control:
- A toggleable hamburger menu to show or hide the sidebar navigation.
- A switch between the hamburger and 'cross' icons based on the sidebar's visibility.

2.User Feedback:
-An alert prompts users if the CV download option is unavailable.

3.Form Validation:
-Ensures the name, email, and phone fields in the contact form are filled before 
 submission.
-Provides an acknowledgment message upon successful form completion.
